## Research Experience

### **Software Architectural Research Group, USC** | Architectural Change and Decay in Open-source Software Systems
**Los Angeles, CA, U.S. | Feb. 2014 - July 2018**
- Reversed architectures of over 800 versions of 23 open-source systems, totaling over 120 MLOCs
- Found evolution trends related to architectural changes in software systems, rate of architectural decay occurrences, correlations among implementation decisions and architectural changes
- Use implicit problems, e.g., architectural- and code-smells, in combination with explicit problems, e.g. reported issues and bugs, to provide an accurate, systematic and in depth approach to predict potential system problems, particularly bugs
- Cooperated with Huawei USA in a study of how to adapt the company's codebase to architectural changes in new Android versions
